## Scenario

You are a security professional at a large organization. You mainly work with their research team. Part of your job is to ensure users on this team are authorized with the appropriate permissions. This helps keep the system secure. 

Your task is to examine existing permissions on the file system. You’ll need to determine if the permissions match the authorization that should be given. If they do not match, you’ll need to modify the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access.

## Project description

In this scenario, the research team tasked me to modify the permissions for files and directories within the **project** directory. The operating system is Linux, indicating that the task require a command-line interface (Linux Bash Shell) approach via Linux Terminal. 

## Check file and directory details

The command you can use to check permissions is:

```bash
ls -la
```

The `projects` directory contains the following files and directories with their respective permissions: a hidden file `.project_x.txt` with permissions `-rw--w----`, a directory `drafts` with permissions `drwx--x---`, and four regular files: `project_k.txt` with permissions `-rw-rw-rw-`, `project_m.txt` with permissions `-rw-r-----`, `project_r.txt` with permissions `-rw-rw-r--`, and `project_t.txt` also with permissions `-rw-rw-r--`. These permissions control the access levels for the owner, group, and others.

## Describe the permission string

1. **`.project_x.txt`: `-rw--w----`**
   - `-`: Regular file.
   - `rw-`: The owner has read and write permissions.
   - `-w-`: The group has only write permissions.
   - `---`: Others have no permissions.

2. **`drafts`: `drwx--x---`**
   - `d`: Directory.
   - `rwx`: The owner has read, write, and execute permissions.
   - `--x`: The group has only execute permissions.
   - `---`: Others have no permissions.

3. **`project_k.txt`: `-rw-rw-rw-`**
   - `-`: Regular file.
   - `rw-`: The owner has read and write permissions.
   - `rw-`: The group has read and write permissions.
   - `rw-`: Others have read and write permissions.

4. **`project_m.txt`: `-rw-r-----`**
   - `-`: Regular file.
   - `rw-`: The owner has read and write permissions.
   - `r--`: The group has read permissions.
   - `---`: Others have no permissions.

5. **`project_r.txt`: `-rw-rw-r--`**
   - `-`: Regular file.
   - `rw-`: The owner has read and write permissions.
   - `rw-`: The group has read and write permissions.
   - `r--`: Others have only read permissions.

6. **`project_t.txt`: `-rw-rw-r--`**
   - `-`: Regular file.
   - `rw-`: The owner has read and write permissions.
   - `rw-`: The group has read and write permissions.
   - `r--`: Others have only read permissions.

These permission strings determine what actions the owner, group, and others can perform on each file and directory within the `projects` directory.
## Change file permissions

Based on the permissions established, the file `project_k.txt` currently has write permissions for others (`-rw-rw-rw-`), which is against the organization's policy of not allowing write access to others.

To modify the permissions and remove the write access for others, we will use the following Linux command:

```bash
chmod o-w project_k.txt
```

This command uses `chmod` (change mode) with the `o-w` option, which removes write permissions for others (`o`) on the file `project_k.txt`. After running this command, the permissions for `project_k.txt` would change to `-rw-rw-r--`, ensuring that others no longer have write access.

## Change file permissions on a hidden file

To set the appropriate permissions for `.project_x.txt` such that no one has write permissions, but both the user and the group can read the file, we will use the following Linux command:

```bash
chmod 440 .project_x.txt
```

This command sets the permissions to `-r--r-----`, which means:

- `r--`: The owner (user) has read permissions.
- `r--`: The group has read permissions.
- `---`: Others have no permissions.

After running this command, `.project_x.txt` will be readable by the user and group, with no write permissions for anyone.

## Change directory permissions

To ensure that only the user `researcher2` can access the `drafts` directory and its contents, you need to set the permissions so that the user has full access, and both the group and others have no access. 

```bash
chmod u+rwx,g-rwx,o-rwx drafts
```

This command modifies the permissions as follows:

- `u+rwx`: Grants the owner (user) read, write, and execute permissions.
- `g-rwx`: Removes all permissions (read, write, execute) for the group.
- `o-rwx`: Removes all permissions (read, write, execute) for others.

After running this command, only `researcher2` will have the necessary permissions to access, modify, or execute files within the `drafts` directory.
## Summary

Throughout this project, I identified files and directories that required permissions adjustments to align with the organization’s security guidelines. I used Linux commands to modify permissions, ensuring that only authorized users could access or modify certain files, while protecting sensitive data from unauthorized write access. These tasks demonstrated my ability to manage and enforce file security policies effectively using Linux.
