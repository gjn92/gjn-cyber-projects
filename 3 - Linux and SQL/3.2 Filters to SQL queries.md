## Scenario

You are a security professional at a large organization. Part of your job is to investigate security issues to help keep the system secure. You recently discovered some potential security issues that involve login attempts and employee machines.

Your task is to examine the organization’s data in their employees and log_in_attempts tables. You’ll need to use SQL filters to retrieve records from different datasets and investigate the potential security issues.

## Project description

In this project, I’ll use SQL to analyze the `employees` and `log_in_attempts` tables to investigate potential security issues. I’ll identify suspicious login attempts, cross-check them with employee data, and flag any irregular activity or potential threats to help protect the organization’s systems.
## Retrieve after hours failed login attempts

#### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_time > '18:00'
AND success = 0;
```

#### Description:
This SQL query retrieves all failed login attempts that occurred after business hours (18:00). It filters the `log_in_attempts` table by checking two conditions: 
1. The `login_time` must be later than 18:00.
2. The `success` column must have a value of `0`, indicating a failed login attempt. 
The query returns records matching both conditions, helping to identify suspicious after-hours login activity.

## Retrieve login attempts on specific dates

#### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_date = '2022-05-09' 
OR login_date = '2022-05-08';
```

#### Description:
This SQL query retrieves all login attempts that occurred on either 2022-05-09 or 2022-05-08. The `WHERE` clause filters the `log_in_attempts` table, selecting records where the `login_date` matches either of these two dates using the `OR` operator. This allows you to review all login activity on the day of the suspicious event (2022-05-09) and the day before (2022-05-08).

## Retrieve login attempts outside of Mexico

#### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE country NOT LIKE '%MEX%';
```

#### Description:
This SQL query retrieves all login attempts that occurred outside of Mexico. It uses the `NOT LIKE` operator to filter the `country` column for values that do not include "MEX" or "MEXICO". The `%` wildcard allows the query to match any value that contains "MEX" as part of the string, ensuring that both "MEX" and "MEXICO" are excluded from the results. This query helps identify all login attempts that originated outside of Mexico.

## Retrieve employees in Marketing

#### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Marketing'
AND office LIKE 'East-%';
```

#### Description:
This SQL query retrieves all employees who work in the Marketing department and are located in the East building. The `WHERE` clause filters the `employees` table by:
1. Checking that the `department` is 'Marketing'.
2. Using the `LIKE` operator with the wildcard `%` to ensure that the `office` starts with "East-", regardless of the specific room number.
This query helps identify employees from the Marketing department in all offices of the East building for the security updates.

## Retrieve employees in Finance or Sales

#### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Sales'
OR department = 'Finance';
```

#### Description:
This SQL query retrieves all employees who work in either the Sales or Finance departments. The `WHERE` clause uses the `OR` operator to filter the `employees` table, selecting records where the `department` is either 'Sales' or 'Finance'. This query helps identify all employees in these two departments for the necessary security updates.

## Retrieve all employees not in IT

#### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees
WHERE department != 'Information Technology';
```

#### Description:
This SQL query retrieves all employees who are not part of the Information Technology department. The `WHERE` clause uses the `!=` (not equal to) operator to filter out any records where the `department` is 'Information Technology'. This query helps identify all employees in other departments who still need the security update.
## Summary

Throughout the tasks, I applied SQL filters to query login attempts and employee data, investigating suspicious activities such as failed login attempts, after-hours logins, and specific department updates. By focusing on specific conditions like excluding certain countries or departments, I helped ensure that appropriate actions were taken to secure the system and maintain data integrity within the organization. These queries demonstrate how SQL can be leveraged to efficiently solve security-related challenges.
