### Operational environment:

The bank is located in a coastal area with low crime rates. Many people and systems handle the bank's data—100 on-premise employees and 20 remote employees. The customer base of the bank includes 2,000 individual accounts and 200 commercial accounts. The bank's services are marketed by a professional sports team and ten local businesses in the community. There are strict financial regulations that require the bank to secure their data and funds, like having enough cash available each day to meet Federal Reserve requirements.

**Notes:**

Security events are possible due to a combination of human error (e.g., phishing attacks) and technical vulnerabilities (e.g., poorly encrypted databases or publicly accessible backups). Though the coastal location has low crime rates, potential risks still exist from internal mismanagement or external disruptions, requiring strong cybersecurity protocols to protect the bank’s assets.

This prioritization helps the security team focus on the most critical risks first, especially those with higher priority scores.
  
  

Asset: The asset at risk of being harmed, damaged, or stolen.

Risk(s): A potential risk to the organization's information systems and data.

Description: A vulnerability that might lead to a security incident.

Likelihood: Score from 1-3 of the chances of a vulnerability being exploited. A 1 means there's a low likelihood, a 2 means there's a moderate likelihood, and a 3 means there's a high likelihood.

Severity: Score from 1-3 of the potential damage the threat would cause to the business. A 1 means a low severity impact, a 2 is a moderate severity impact, and a 3 is a high severity impact.

Priority: How quickly a risk should be addressed to avoid the potential incident. Use the following formula to calculate the overall score: Likelihood x Impact Severity = Risk
