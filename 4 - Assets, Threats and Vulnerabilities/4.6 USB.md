### Scenario

You are part of the security team at Rhetorical Hospital and arrive to work one morning. On the ground of the parking lot, you find a USB stick with the hospital's logo printed on it. There’s no one else around who might have dropped it, so you decide to pick it up out of curiosity.

You bring the USB drive back to your office where the team has virtualization software installed on a workstation. Virtualization software can be used for this very purpose because it’s one of the only ways to safely investigate an unfamiliar USB stick. The software works by running a simulated instance of the computer on the same workstation. This simulation isn’t connected to other files or networks, so the USB drive can’t affect other systems if it happens to be infected with malicious software.

Jorge's drive contains a mix of personal and work-related files. For example, it contains folders that appear to store family and pet photos. There is also a new hire letter and an employee shift schedule. The flash drive appears to contain a mixture of personal and work-related files. Consider how an attacker might use this information if they obtained it. Also, consider whether this whole event w

| **Contents**         | The USB drive contains both personal and work-related files, including sensitive information such as an employee shift schedule, a new hire letter, and budget reports. Additionally, the drive contains personal documents like family photos, a wedding list, and vacation ideas. This mix of files presents a risk, as it includes both personally identifiable information (PII) and confidential work data, making it a valuable target for attackers to exploit.                                                                                                          |
| **Attacker mindset** | An attacker could have intentionally left the USB drive to lure Jorge or a colleague into plugging it into their workstation. The mix of personal and work files serves as a distraction, while the real objective might be to install malware or create a backdoor into the hospital’s systems. Sensitive information, such as employee schedules and PII, could also be exploited for further attacks, including phishing or identity theft.                                                                                                                                  |
| **Risk analysis**    | USB baiting attacks could deliver malware such as keyloggers, ransomware, or trojans, allowing attackers to steal credentials, encrypt critical files, or exfiltrate sensitive data. Technical controls like disabling USB ports on company devices or using antivirus software to scan external devices can prevent infections. Operational controls include employee training on the dangers of using unknown USB drives. Managerial controls, such as enforcing strict data-handling policies and separating personal and business drives, can further mitigate these risks. |
