## Scenario

One of the most valuable assets in the world today is information. Most information is accessed over a network. There tend to be a variety of devices connected to a network and each is a potential entry point to other assets.

An inventory of network devices can be a useful asset management tool. An inventory can highlight sensitive assets that require extra protection.

You’re operating a small business from your home and must create an inventory of your network devices. This will help you determine which ones contain sensitive information that require extra protection.

To do this, you will start by identifying three devices that have access to your home network. This might include devices such as:

- Desktop or laptop computers
    
- Smartphones
    
- Smart home devices
    
- Game consoles
    
- Storage devices or servers
    
- Video streaming devices
    

Here is the updated asset inventory with **Sensitivity** classifications based on the information provided:

| Asset             | Network Access | Owner      | Location          | Notes                                                                                         | Sensitivity   | Categories          | Access Designation      |
|-------------------|----------------|------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| 1. Network Router | Continuous     | ISP        | On-premises       | Uses 2.4 GHz for smart devices and 5 GHz for all others. Handles all network traffic securely.   | Confidential  |                     |                         |
| 2. Desktop        | Occasional     | Homeowner  | Home Office Desk  | Contains sensitive information, such as photos and business documents. Password protected.       | Restricted    | Restricted           | Need-to-know             |
| 3. Guest Smartphone | Occasional   | Friend     | On and Off-premises | Limited access to the network. Primarily used for communication. May not have strict security.   | Internal-only | Confidential         | Limited to specific users|
| 4. Smart TV       | Occasional     | Homeowner  | Living Room       | Used for streaming services. Connects via Wi-Fi. Low risk of sensitive information.              | Internal-only | Users on-premises    |                         |
| 5. Printer        | Occasional     | Homeowner  | Home Office       | Wireless connection. Used to print business documents. May store temporary sensitive data.       | Internal-only | Users on-premises    |                         |
| 6. Tablet         | Occasional     | Homeowner  | Throughout House  | Contains light work data and internet browsing history. Password protected, used for casual work. | Confidential  | Restricted           | Limited to specific users|

### Sensitivity Classifications:
- **Network Router**: **Confidential** — Critical for network management and security, needs to be protected from unauthorized access.
- **Desktop**: **Restricted** — Stores private, sensitive information like business documents, requiring high security.
- **Guest Smartphone**: **Internal-only** — Limited access device; less strict security but should still be controlled.
- **Smart TV**: **Internal-only** — Low risk device, used only for streaming, not sensitive.
- **Printer**: **Internal-only** — Could store sensitive data temporarily, but low risk if well-managed.
- **Tablet**: **Confidential** — Holds business-related data and personal information; needs protection, but not as sensitive as the desktop.

This classification highlights which devices require more security and protection based on the type of data they hold and the potential impact if they were compromised.
