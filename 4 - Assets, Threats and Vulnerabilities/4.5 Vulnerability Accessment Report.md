## **Vulnerability Assessment Report**

### **System Description**

_The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections._

### **Scope**

_The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 20XX to August 20XX._ [_NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fc4L2azQlnUM-8r43PU9mYlT30BnxTwdjAMqpT7JeZk/edit?resourcekey=0-Q-XglnC3Li7JPK2hIvMkVg%23heading=h.hvbcmqwzo9do) _is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system._

### **Purpose**

_The purpose of this vulnerability analysis is to assess the security of the database server, which is critical for managing business data and supporting operations. The server stores sensitive information, including customer and financial data, which makes it a valuable asset. Securing the data is essential to ensure business continuity, maintain regulatory compliance, and prevent reputational damage. If the server were disabled or compromised, it could lead to significant financial losses, operational downtime, and legal consequences for the business._

| _Human (Insider Threat)_       | _A malicious or negligent employee or administrator could intentionally or accidentally alter or delete critical business data stored on the database server, severely impacting operations._                        | _2_              | _3_            | _6_        |
| _Technological (Malware)_      | _A hacker or advanced persistent threat (APT) could install malicious software designed to persist on the server, potentially exfiltrating data or corrupting the database over time._                               | _3_              | _3_            | _9_        |
| _Environmental (Power Outage)_ | _A sudden power outage or failure in the power supply could disrupt the database server’s operations, causing temporary or permanent loss of data, and preventing the business from conducting critical operations._ | _1_              | _2_            | _2_        |

### **Approach**

_In this qualitative vulnerability assessment, I selected the three threat sources—insider threat, malware, and power outage—based on their relevance to the organization’s database server. Insider threats and malware represent common, high-impact risks that could compromise sensitive business data, disrupt operations, and lead to significant financial or reputational loss. Power outages, while less frequent, pose a threat to critical business functions if not mitigated. These threat events were chosen for their potential to affect the business’s operational continuity, data integrity, and overall security posture. Identifying and addressing these risks is crucial for maintaining system resilience._

### **Remediation Strategy**

_To mitigate the insider threat risk, implementing the_ **_Principle of Least Privilege_** _will ensure that employees only have access to the information required for their roles, minimizing the chances of accidental or malicious data alterations._ **_Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)_** _can help prevent unauthorized access and malware installation by adding an extra layer of security to sensitive accounts. Additionally,_ **_Defense in Depth_** _can reduce the likelihood of malware infiltration by using layered security controls, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and regular software updates. These controls will collectively help secure the database server against high-risk vulnerabilities._
